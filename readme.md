## 🎯 Features

### ✅ 2D Mode

- to run: python 2d-playground.py
- Rotate and scale 2D shapes (like squares or polygons)
- Interactive version lets you **drag vertices** and **use sliders** for live transformations

### ✅ 3D Mode

- to run: python 3d-playground.py
- Rotate, scale, and translate a cube in 3D space
- Adjust **rotation angles (X, Y, Z)** and **scale** with interactive sliders
- **Orbit and zoom** the camera using your mouse
- Optional: drag vertices in screen space to reshape the cube
